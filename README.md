To delete your new message, just add reaction with ❌ on it

## [Autorole]

When a member or bot joins your server, it gets the role specified for the its type

## [Level System]

If enabled, when user will send message, he'll get xp for it

You can add/remove/set user level add ignore roles/channels, change cooldown to get next xp, add role reward by getting some level, set channel for level up messages (DM by default) and finally reset user(s) xp/level settings

## [Role by reaction]
